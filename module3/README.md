Run
'make block'

in order to output 6 different executables
that will run the 'blocks.cu' file with varying array size
and block sizes. I made changes to accept compiler
arguments to define the block size and array size.


Run
'make grid'

to compile grid.cu into a single executable. I made more
iterations in the for-loop to display several interesting
new dimensions as output.
